title: arac - neural networking library 
---

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  arac is a library for neural networking applications with the following in 
  mind:
  <ul>
      <li>As fast as possible without ugly code.</li>
      <li>As flexible as performance allows.</li>
      <li>Glue it together - use high level languages to solve your problem 
      without losing the speed.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Features</h2>
  Currently, the following is included:
  <ul>
    <li>Feedforward, recurrent and multi-dimensional recurrent neural networks with long short-term memory (LSTM) cells.
    <li>Backprop and backprop through time training</li>
    <li>Datasets of various forms</li>
  </ul>
  Furthermore, all algorithms are usable either via C++ or Python via
  <a href="http://pybrain.org">PyBrain</a>.

  <h2>Dependencies</h2>
  arac uses <a href="http://scons.org">scons</a> for building and
  <a href="http://www.netlib.org/lapack/">LAPACK</a> for fast linear algebra
  operations.

  <h2>Download</h2>
